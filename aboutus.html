  <p>About Us

The search consultants at Olsen Day have completed difficult searches for top-tier companies in a variety of industries and functional areas. Following are the core components of our business philosophy.

Senior people to fill senior positions – Our search consultants have extensive business backgrounds. Searches are not handed off to junior staff members. This ensures that every contact with a prospective candidate is handled with the highest level of professionalism and discretion.
Partnering at a new level - All good executive search firms include an in-person interview as part of the candidate assessment process. At Olsen Day, we take this a step further. Once a candidate has been selected by a client to be interviewed, we will participate in the client's first interview with the candidate. This can be time intensive, but the information gained in observing the interview first-hand enables our search consultants to refine the search on a real-time basis, which ultimately improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the search.
The importance of research – We believe in excellent research. We do not rely on our existing database to be the primary source of candidates. Our search consultants have very well developed research skills, and we also utilize a network of extraordinarily capable executive search researchers. Because each search is different, the importance of these research capabilities cannot be overstated.

Long term view – Every time we contact a new candidate, we reach out in a respectful, professional manner with a view toward establishing a relationship that will be of long-term benefit to both parties. If a qualified candidate is interested in our client's opportunity – then we pursue it together. If not, we don't, but then we work to follow our candidates' career paths. Our search consultants have successfully placed some candidates years after their initial conversation. Likewise with clients, our goal is to provide personalized, tailored service with a focus on results, which leads to multiple assignments and to long-term relationships.</p>
